             <p>Hi, I'm a software engineer specialised in frontend and backend development for complex scalable web apps. Welcome to my personal website!. Firstly, let me tell you about my journey from non-IT background to the software world. I was always fascinated by the term 'computers' and wanted to know more about it. I started learning about computers since school and introduction to programming increased the curiosity level. It was  that passion and curiosity that enabled me to take programming in high school and college level. I started with learning C and later C++. Although, I have graduated in Engineering with a degree in Electronics & Communication; I never gave any less importance to computer and programming. I believe that in today's world it(computer) is a very fundamental and vital assest and everyone should be computer literate. After engineering, I got placed into HR field where I worked mostly on training and taking interviews. Even though it was a good learning experience being an HR, but that was not my 'CALL'. I always wanted to be a programmer and write codes. Hence, I decided to quit my HR job and chase my 'Passion'. The journey wasn't so easy as I expected; I had to make myself desciplined to learn everything from scratch and prepare for my next job. Finally, I have managed to achieve my 'Dream Profession' and I'm  absolutely proud of myself. Somebody said it right...' Where there is Will, There is a Way !..'</p>

             <p>The software industry is never a stable industry (in terms of technology) and things keep changing every two-three years which makes this job even more challenging. So, it is important to constantly keep upgrading to survive and hence I'm following the same. <!-- I do my best work when I'm exploring new and disparate ideas, designing across disciplines and helping others to do same. I'm a strong advocate and practitioner of human-centered and social responsible design. --> Entrepreneurial in spirit and collaborative by nature. I have an equally creative and analytical mind and a passion for tackling complex challenges that leads to positive change.  My dream is to work someday for big Tech companies like Google, Amazon, Microsoft.</p>

             <p>Beside Technology, I also have interest in sports, music, and travelling. As a part of my social-service initiatives, I have closely worked with many social organisations & NGOs and contributed in child education and other social causes. I also write about software technologies and social issues on my <a href="blog.html"><strong><u>blog</u></strong></a>.
